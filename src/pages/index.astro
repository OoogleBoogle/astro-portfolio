      With around 6 years experience working for R/GA at Google on several of
      their largest marketing sites, I've developed a passion for clean, readable, and
      maintainable code with a focus on accessibility and sensible user interactions. With
      a keen eye for detail and excellent communication skills, I pride myself on easily
      developing strong working relationships with clients and colleagues alike, with a
      confident, outgoing, enthusiastic and approachable attitude.
