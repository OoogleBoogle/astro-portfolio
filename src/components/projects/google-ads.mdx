There are many sites within Google that share brand identity, and for this they
have a rather excellent internal JavaScript framework and static site builder
that does the majority of the heavy lifting. However, issues arose when a design
required changes to the provided components as there was no way to share these
easily. The team was tasked with creating a UI Library that could be easily
shared around, but without the use of *any*  external frameworks.

I took some inspiration from Lit.js and created a framework, installed via NPM,
that sat on top of the internal tools. When provided with a JSON file of a set structure, it would
output pages sections from statically rendered Web Components either as individual entities, or
fully compiled pages. I also setup a Storybook.js so designers could preview the
page sections for use in other sites.

During the site build I helped the Tech Lead oversee the project, assisting the
globally located team with framework bug fixes as they arose, code reviews, and
general mentoring, as well as building out a few of the page components (main
navigation, homepage hero, carousels, etc).
