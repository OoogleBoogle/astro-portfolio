The original version of this site has long since passed, but a gif of the site
flow still exists in the blog post linked above.

We were tasked with creating a site that would launch on International Small
Business Day. It would contain an app-like experience where, during a series of
questions, users could add details about their business and be provided a series
of product recommendations that could help them grow.

The main obstacle was that every question and
recommendation needed to be statically rendered ahead of time, which amounted to ~40
individual product recommendations. To prevent bloating the DOM, I devised a way to compile all
questions and outcomes as an AngularJS template file which was then only
requested if a user decided to take that route, which was loaded into the Angular's
template cache.

The site was initially launched in the US and Brazil, with other locales added
over time. It was featured in several online publications, such as

<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/google-for-small-business/"

<a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/07/google-for-small-business.html"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smallbiztrends.com</a> and
was generally well received.
