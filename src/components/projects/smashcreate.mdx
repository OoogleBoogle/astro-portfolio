Built with Next.JS on Vercel and Tailwind.css, this was a solo endevour helping
out a startup to convert a Figma design to a fully fleshed out website as fast
as possible. For the sake of time, we began without a CMS, and instead just
created a single JSON file that contained the content. Then, with a quick
introduction to Git, I was able to set the founder up so they can can make
continual copy edits while I focused on the site build.  Where possible
animations are handled in CSS for GPU accelleration, Cal.com was integrated
for creating direct meetings with the company, and Embla utilized for the 2 main carousels.

In all, from conception to production, the site took around 30-40 hours.
