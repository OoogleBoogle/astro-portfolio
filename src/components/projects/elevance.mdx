The brief was straightforward, however the timeline was tight and I was the only
dev on the project. It was also important to bring the existing code up to date,
remove some out of date dependencies, and make it more responsive overall.

Leveraging Nuxt.js, I was able to rebuild the whole site from scratch in just
two weeks. This included a Report Builder which allows a user to select
individual report sections and download them as a single PDF. The previous
version required jQuery and would send a query to a backend php script to pull
and compile the PDF on a separate server. I revamped this to build the PDF's
in the front end, allowing the individual PDF sections to be housed in the main
codebase to improve maintainability as well as remove the jQuery dependency. It
also compiled to less code in the front end and surprisingly low latency.
