The corporate site for the creative arm of the consulting firm
<a href="https://www.sia-partners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer">Sia Partners</a>. The brief was to take the website of
the recently aquired, and well established, ad agency
<a href="https://addison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener
noreferrer">Addison</a> and use it to showcase the additional input from
SiaX.

Addison's site is a standard WordPress site, and we wanted to keep all the good
things about WordPress as a CMS but modernize it. Therefore, using Faust.js, I was
able seperate the front end and build the site in Next.JS using GraphQL
to query WordPress as a headless CMS. This helps us to improve security by
hiding most references to WordPress, and also increase page speed by utilizing
Next/Vercel's ISR functionality.
