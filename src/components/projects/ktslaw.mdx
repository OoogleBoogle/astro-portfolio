As part of Kilpatrick Townsend's global rebrand, I was tasked with updating
existing the pages to align with the new brand stratergy, as well as creating a
new Home and About Us pages that would integrate with their existing tech stack.

The site was originally built a long time ago by an external development team
using SiteCore, and had in excess of 6000 pages and a lot of code to handle
them. I felt it was important that my additions to the codebase be as light as
possible while not increasing complexity.

For the new pages I devised a method utilizing Web Components to handle all the
page interactivity. This meant I was able to keep the code compartmentalized
where necessary and avoided bloating the global JS. It also enabled me to hand
over small components to the internal dev team to implement on their production
server with nothing more than a copy and paste. I posted a brief introduction
to statically rendered web components on medium based on this work.

For the refresh of the existing pages, while working alongside Kilpatrick's
internal developers, it was a case of digging through a monolithic CSS file and
updating various base styles to bring them up to date with the new branding,
tweaking existing jQuery code to iron out a few longstanding bugs,
all while removing as much dead code as possible.

Overall the project went much smoother than we anticipated and was completed
ahead of schedule.
